DO:

(—see if center node can be removed)

— The zoom popup still gets triggered by the scroll inertia
— Ideally remove event listeners
— Panning and Zooming to Node group only works on first time clicking the group filter

— Check how to differentiate between Chrome and Safari for -webkit positioning (-40 works for chrome, -20 works for safari)

END: Disable right click
