DO:

(—see if center node can be removed)
—length of arrows should be shorter
—ideally nothing crossing
—Insure mobile versions work on touch

— The zoom popup appears alos when its fully zoomed and you try to continue zooming
— Ideally remove event listeners
— Panning and Zooming to Node group only works on first time clicking the group filter
— Nodes Tend to get too far away from the arrow in the yellow group
