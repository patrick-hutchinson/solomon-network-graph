DO:

(—see if center node can be removed)
—length of arrows should be shorter
—ideally nothing crossing
—Insure mobile versions work on touch

— Clicking on a Group Filter only expands that group
-- in ~950, add a statement that checks if the group filter was clicked or not. if it wasnt, do what already is being done. Else, dont, and instead toggle the visibility of the nodes that are part of that group only.

— The zoom popup appears alos when its fully zoomed and you try to continue zooming
— Ideally remove event listeners
— Zoom only works on first time clicking the group filter
— Nodes Tend to get too far away from the arrow in the yellow group

END: Disable right click
